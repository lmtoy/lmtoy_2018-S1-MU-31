Two sources:

- B59 : the main source, but VLSR must be wrong. There's a line at VLSR ~ 200.  Map area 500" x 500"

Some birdies visible.

92634: beams 0,1,4,5,12,13 have alternating high order baselines, not usable

92825: default vlsr/dv/dw messed up; nothing detected even after correcting.

- OH2.6-0.4 : a pointing source
