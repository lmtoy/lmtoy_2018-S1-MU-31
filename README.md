Two sources:

- B59 : the main source, but VLSR must be wrong. There's a line at VLSR ~ 200.  Map area 500" x 500"

Some birdies visible.

92634: beams 0,1,4,5,12,13 have alternating high order baselines, not usable

92825: default vlsr/dv/dw messed up; nothing detected even after correcting.  should also remove
two birdies, but these are in the 8k channel mode, where birdies cover several channels. Unlike
in 92634 there is no signal here.

The PEAK map shows the source is offset from the center, this is a good case where an offset
position for the final spectrum (plot 13) is needed.

- OH2.6-0.4 : a pointing source
